  memoryText: "Essam, my beautiful boy. Some call him my shadow, and they aren\u2019t
    wrong. He always wants to join me wherever I go. You can hear his little feet
    running to catch up. He loves reading the Quran and praying with me. When I do
    my prayers he tries to copy everything I do. I stand up, he stands, I sit, he
    sits, all while muttering suras to the best of his abilities. I take him to the
    mosque with me on Fridays where he tries to follow along with prayers but gets
    distracted and runs around with other kids. On Mondays I return to work for the
    week, which is the worst part of my day since I\u2019m saying goodbye to his
    adorable little face. When I get home he runs to the door to open it for me jumping
    from joy and starts excitedly telling me about his day and how he helped his
    mother. I love watching him grow into the great man I know he will be someday.
    For his birthday this year we got him his first ever prayer rug, its child size
    and adorable. He is going to be so excited, I can\u2019t wait to give it to him. "
