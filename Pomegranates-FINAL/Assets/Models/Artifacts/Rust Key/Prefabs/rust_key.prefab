  memoryText: "Today I turn thirteen, my parents threw me a big birthday party and
    invited all of my friends and our family (and some of their friends too of course\u2026).
    They even rented a bouncy house! I was about to go in before the party started
    but then my mother told me she wanted to show me something first. She said she
    had been waiting since I was born to show me this, and as her only child it was
    extremely important for me to understand it. It was a key, but it was different.
    I\u2019ve never seen a key like it before. She explained that this key had been
    in our family for generations, how our family was kicked out of our home during
    the Nakba and forced to flee to Gaza. When we got to Gaza this church took my
    family in, fed and sheltered us. My family originally thought that they could
    return in a few weeks after things had settled, but weeks turned into years,
    years into decades, decades into generations. My mother helped me find a special
    place in my room to put it away. I know I must keep it safe because this key
    is a symbol. Not of loss, but a symbol of our return."
