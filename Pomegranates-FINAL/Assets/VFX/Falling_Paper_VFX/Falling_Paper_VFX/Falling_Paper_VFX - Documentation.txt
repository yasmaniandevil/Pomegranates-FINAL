Load one of the three example scenes, or simply drag the required paper effect from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

The falling paper comes in two variations; version A falls straight down while version B drifts sideways as well as down. The paper explosion effect is trigged by pressing the space bar.

Have fun!
